            rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with
            soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that

            <h5>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and
            anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or
            sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth
            which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in
            the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing
            has the disease.</h5>

              Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth

            <h5>Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once
            contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or
            mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you
            sick.</h5>

            hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent
            elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used
            tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good
            respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses
            such as cold, flu and COVID-19.</h5>
